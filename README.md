# Arduino-one-LED-blink-project.
Here's how you can connect and code for an Arduino single  LED blink project.
Components Needed:
Arduino Uno (or any compatible Arduino board)
LED (1 piece)
220-ohm resistor
Breadboard (optional)
Jumper wires
Circuit Connection:
LED Connections:
Anode (+) (long leg of the LED) connects to pin 13 of the Arduino.
Cathode (-) (short leg of the LED) connects to the ground (GND) via a 220-ohm resistor.
(You can also use a breadboard for easier connections.)
Pin diagram:

Pin 13 (Digital) -> Resistor (220 ohms) -> LED anode (+)
Ground (GND) -> LED cathode (-)
